About me

I am currently a technological undergraduate student in System Analysis and Development at Fatec Ipiranga, Sao Paulo Brazil.
I'm from the tech industry, and I used to work with Helpdesk and Tech Support (Linux, Microsoft Windows and its apps), and I'm looking forward to improving skills to get into software development; To improve my knowledge, I take online courses in udacity, udemy and courseera.
